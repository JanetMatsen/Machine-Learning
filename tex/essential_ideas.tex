\begin{itemize}
	\item Never ever \underline{ever} touch the test set
	\item You know you are overfitting when there is a big test between train and test results.  E.g. metric of percent wrong. 
	\item Need to be comfortable taking a hit on fitting accuracy if you can get a benefit on the result.
	\item Bias vs variance trade-off.  
		High bias when the model is too simple \& doesn't fit the data well.  
		High variance is when small changes to the data set lead to large solution changes.
