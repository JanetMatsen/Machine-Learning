\begin{itemize}
	\item Never ever \underline{ever} touch the test set
	\item You know you are overfitting when there is a big test between train and test results.  E.g. metric of percent wrong. 
	\item Need to be comfortable taking a hit on fitting accuracy if you can get a benefit on the result.
	\item Bias vs variance trade-off.  
		High bias when the model is too simple \& doesn't fit the data well.  
		High variance is when small changes to the data set lead to large solution changes. 
	\item If features are non discriminative in the beginning, they don't work for any classifier.  % week 4 reminder
	\item Your feature vector often has a smaller dimension that the feature space.    % week 4, Friday. 
		If you have too long of a feature vector, you may get overfitting.
