\section{Expectation Maximization}
\smallskip \hrule height 2pt \smallskip

A clever method for maximizing marginal likelihood, where you alternate between computing an expectation and a maximization. 

It is not magic: it is still optimizing a non-convex function with lots of local optima.  The computations are just easier. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item as in GMM: $$ \argmax_{\theta} \prod_i P(x^j; \theta) = \argmax \prod_j \sum_{i=1}^k P(y^j=i, x^j; \theta) $$

\end{itemize}
